## Description

For this assignment, I created a workout tracker. I was provided with the front end code in a `Develop` folder. This assignment required me to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.


## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


## Installation
Clone the repository to your local development environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/brandonfordd/e_commerce_backend.git
```

To install all dependencies. 
```
npm i
```

Then to seed test information into database.
```
npm run seed
```

Then to start you server
```
npm run start 
```

Afterwards open http://localhost:3000/ in preferred browser to view the front end.
